# UMAP Evaluation on Simulated scRNA-seq Data

This repository contains code and visualizations for evaluating UMAP embeddings on simulated single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data generated with [SymSim](https://github.com/YosefLab/SymSim). The goal of this project is to systematically explore how different distance metrics and dropout levels affect UMAP performance in sparse, high-dimensional gene expression data.

## üîÅ Version Control and Reproducibility

This project was developed and tested using **Python 3.11.5** and the latest available versions (as of runtime) of the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scanpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`
- `pickle` (Python built-in)

To ensure reproducibility, we recommend creating a virtual environment and using:

bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# üìÅ Data Access

The datasets used in this project are stored externally due to their size.

You can access and download all datasets here:

üîó [Google Drive ‚Äì UMAP scRNA-seq Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JDoNXzZA_zlaCrL6FRGtp7H4gGrwB3-E?usp=sharing)

After downloading, place the datasets into a `data/` folder at the root of this project with the following structure:
data/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ S500/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ S5000/

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ S10000/

This structure is expected by the notebooks in this repository. Make sure to maintain the folder names.
