# UMAP Evaluation on Simulated scRNA-seq Data

This repository contains code and visualizations for evaluating UMAP embeddings on simulated single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data generated with [SymSim](https://github.com/YosefLab/SymSim). The goal of this project is to systematically explore how different distance metrics and dropout levels affect UMAP performance in sparse, high-dimensional gene expression data.

## üìÅ Folder Overview
All figures, notebooks, and plots are grouped by dataset and analysis type.

### üîπ UMAP_S500/

Contains all UMAP and evaluation plots for the **S500 simple** and **S500 complex** datasets.

#### Files:
- `UMAP_ALL_S500.ipynb`  
  UMAP embeddings for **S500 simple** across all dropout levels (0.1‚Äì0.9).
  
- `UMAP_ALL_S500_O.ipynb`  
  UMAP embeddings for **S500 complex** (nested subclasses) across all dropout levels.

- `UMAP_S500_UMAPSFORPAPER_DROPOUT04_06.ipynb`  
  Focused UMAP visualizations of **S500 simple** at dropout 0.4 and 0.6 for the paper.

- `UMAP_S500.ipynb`  
  UMAP visualizations for the **S500 simple** dataset with no dropout.

- `UMAP_S500C.ipynb`  
  UMAP visualizations for the **S500 complex** dataset with no dropout.

#### üìä Evaluation Metric Sensitivity (S500 only):
To investigate metric bias in evaluation, we generated UMAPs using a fixed metric (Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski) and evaluated each using all three metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski p=0.5).

These comparisons are stored as:
- `UMAP_EVALMETRICS_EUCLIDEAN_S500.png`  
  UMAP built with Euclidean, evaluated with Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski.
  
- `UMAP_EVALMETRICS_MANHATTAN_S500.png`  
  UMAP built with Manhattan, evaluated with all three metrics.
  
- `UMAP_EVALMETRICS_MINKOWSKI_S500.png`  
  UMAP built with Minkowski (p=0.5), evaluated with all three metrics.
